# 2. Heat wave (Temperature)

## 2.1. Climate

-   There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter

    -   It is usually extremely dry except for the monsoon season.

        | Month         | The Average Maximum Temperature |
        |---------------|---------------------------------|
        | Nov - Feb     | 30Â°C / 86Â°F                     |
        | **Mar - Jun** | **43Â°C / 109Â°F : hot ðŸ”¥**       |

-   In May 2010, hundreds of casualties (over 1,344 people) in the worst-ever heat wave reached 46.8Â°C (116.2Â°F).

    -   the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) developed **the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan**, in partnership with an international coalition of health and academic groups and with support from the Climate & Development Knowledge Network.


## 2.2. Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan

### 2.2.1. What is it for?

-   Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and coordinating responses **to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations.** ðŸ¥µ

```

-   **The first comprehensive plan and early warning system in South Asia** to address the threat of adverse heat on health.

-   It is evaluated and updated annually. ðŸ“†

### 2.2.2. How does it work? (Key plan)

-   Focusing on community participation
-   Building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat
-   Training medical and community workers
-   Coordinating an inter-agency emergency warning system 

::: callout-note
Focus on two highly vulnerable population groups: slum communities and outdoor workers
:::

### 2.2.3. Who does work with?

-   It is informed by the Australian State of Victoria's Heatwave Planning Guide for Local Councils. (*Why?*)
-   The Indian Institute of Public Health- Gandhinagar
-   The Indian Meteorological Service
-   The US-based Natural Resources Defence Council


I'd like to emphasise that this plan is internationally connected!


### 2.2.4. How do we analysis?

#### 2.2.4.1. Thermal Infrared Sensors(TIRS) of Landsat 8

-   Obtain surface temperature
-   Compare this image with other images of same area in the past (recorded extreme temperature)

#### 2.2.4.2. Land Surface Temperature (LST)

-   

#### 2.2.4.3. Urban Heat Island (UHI)

-   using satellite and aircraft platforms and has provided new avenues for the observation of UHI

Analyse aviation data using PCA analysis and make a heat wave map.

#### 2.2.4.4. BI, NDVI
