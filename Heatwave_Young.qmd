# 1. Introduction of our topic

-   by Atusmi

# 2. Heat wave (Temperature)

## 2.1. Climate

-   There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter

    -   It is usually extremely dry except for the monsoon season.

        | Month         | The Average Maximum Temperature |
        |---------------|---------------------------------|
        | Nov - Feb     | 30Â°C / 86Â°F                     |
        | **Mar - Jun** | **43Â°C / 109Â°F : hot ðŸ”¥**       |

-   In May 2010, hundreds of casualties (over 1,344 people) in the worst-ever heat wave reached 46.8Â°C (116.2Â°F).

    -   the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) developed **the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan**, in partnership with an international coalition of health and academic groups and with support from the Climate & Development Knowledge Network.

## 2.2. Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan

### 2.2.1. What is it for?

-   Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and coordinating responses **to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations.** ðŸ¥µ

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, fig.cap="Source: [Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan(2019)](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ahmedabad-heat-action-plan-2019-update.pdf)"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/20230301_133423.png')
```

-   **The first comprehensive plan and early warning system in South Asia** to address the threat of adverse heat on health.

-   It is evaluated and updated annually. ðŸ“†

### 2.2.2. How does it work? (Key plan)

-   Focusing on community participation
-   Building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat
-   Training medical and community workers
-   Coordinating an inter-agency emergency warning system

::: callout-note
Focus on two highly vulnerable population groups: slum communities and outdoor workers
:::

### 2.2.3. Who does work with?

-   It is informed by the Australian State of Victoria's Heatwave Planning Guide for Local Councils. (*Why?*)
-   The Indian Institute of Public Health- Gandhinagar
-   The Indian Meteorological Service
-   The US-based Natural Resources Defence Council

I'd like to emphasise that this plan is internationally connected!

### 2.2.4. How do we analysis?

#### 2.2.4.1. Thermal Infrared Sensors(TIRS) of Landsat 8

-   Obtain surface temperature
-   Compare this image with other images of same area in the past (recorded extreme temperature)

#### 2.2.4.2. Land Surface Temperature (LST)

-   

#### 2.2.4.3. Urban Heat Island (UHI)

-   using satellite and aircraft platforms and has provided new avenues for the observation of UHI

Analyse aviation data using PCA analysis and make a heat wave map.

#### 2.2.4.4. BI, NDVI

The section will discuss the Iron Triangle (Time, Budget, Quality) + stakeholder & risk management in our project.

### Aim

The project is aiming for **reliable**, **sustainable** and **cost-effective** approach to reduce the risks in heatwaves in Ahmedabad. To achieve this, the project is divided into several phases with real-time testing. Developers of the system will then convey the instructions on how to use the system to the users. Contractual developer team is small and agile, constraining the human capital costs.

### Stakeholder Management 

The following chart shows the stakeholder network. A critical project team is assembled in the front-end with intensive collaboration with AMC Nodal Officers and other actors.

\[Fig\]

-   **AMC Nodal Officers** are the main coordinator of the project, and the final model will be maintained and operated by them (users).

-   **Project team** is responsible for model developments and testing to ensure the accuracy of prediction and reproducibility (developers).

-   **Other government departments** like transportation, water and planning sectors and **Health professionals** will be in charge of the interventions after receiving the notice from Nodal Officers (response).

-   **Community** will receive the notice from government departments and will obtain necessary resources to combat heat, while being prepared through education and vuluntary support (target).

### Timeline

A timeline for the project from initialisation to long-term interventions is compiled. Since the heat seasons in the city is between March and July, the project/model is projected to be put into use for 2024, while the summer in 2023 would be treated as real-time model testing season.

The project is **seasonal** with front-loaded model planning and development, pre/post summer and during summer monitor. Pre/post summer includes annual reviews, capacity building and infrastructure planning, helping the residents to prepare for heatwaves. During summer, the model will be put into use anytime and urgent medical and other resource supply will be given after the detection on high risk areas.

### Budgeting

\[Fig\]

The budget for the project will largely be spend on the human capital, including 2 model developers, 2 data analysts and 1 project managers in the task force. The costs on office space and equipment are also included. Government departments and heath professionals will be in charge of the interventions and the decision making of types of interventions on high-risk areas, so they are not included in the overall costs. Maintenance and long-term operation of the model is included for 1 year, which is low as compared to model development. Admittedly, together with the possibility of delay and other forms of risks, the budget stated here could be underestimated.

### Quality 

### Risk Management 

\[Fig\]

The timeline and budget plans are designed to prevent project delays and cost overruns, although there could be events that halt project delivery hence expanding the costs or time. To control the project within scope of time and money, the risk assessment is conducted to better cope with uncertainty. The following slide will lists risks and give approaches to mitigate the impacts of them.

### Overall project workflow 

\[Fig\]

This early warning system with strong government support complies to the early warning system in the Heat Action Plan. Adding in the existing Heat Action Plan team, the model proposes the spatial priority for the government in allocating resources, especially for those who are underrepresented.
